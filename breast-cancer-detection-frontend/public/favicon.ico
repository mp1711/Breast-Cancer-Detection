# The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file representing the icon. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you should create or obtain a suitable favicon.ico file and place it in the specified directory. 

# Alternatively, if you want to create a placeholder, you can use the following comment:

# This file is intentionally left blank. Please replace it with a valid favicon.ico file.
